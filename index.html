    woke up he came to get his present. It was a ron doll. The ron doll had a problem his neck was not broken so ron
    said,"what happened to your neck?" Then the ron doll said,"dont worry my master/Mr. Red face usually makes mistakes"
    then cupple seconds later ron doll was hungry, ron doll can feel what ever food he digests so ron got to the kitchen,
    picked up his favorite food of the fridge then put it in the microwave, before ron ate the food ron doll said,"is that
    your favorite food" then ron said "yes"then doll ron said"wold you like me do some magic that when you eat the food it
    will restore back to its original place?" Then ron said,"sure". After ron ate his food it restored to its original place
    the rons dads wine floated up then slammed down the it came back up then shattered, then ron said,"oh no my dads going
    to beat the šĥìť out of me!"then the ron doll said dont worrie your dad is gone After Ron's Mom returns home late again one night from work, this night being Ron's birthday, Bruce accuses her of
    cheating on him and slaps her. This leads to a fight in which the Mom leaves, saying that she will return tomorrow to
    file for a divorce. During that night, Bruce drinks too much and decides to kill Ron, and so he strangles him to the
    point where he breaks his neck. He lock's Ron's body in the closet of his bedroom, and tries to sleep, but the closet
    door opens in the night, leaving Bruce to stare at the dead body of his son in bed, and he begins to hallucinate the
    body moving and talking to him, causing him to break down with guilt as he weeps and begs for forgiveness, begging the
    corpse to "stop punishing me". Eventually, he can't take it anymore, and flees the house, so as not to be caught by
    police.
    
    He decides to check in at a motel he had a business card for before leaving, and decides to wait there for a little
    before trying to leave town, so as to not risk running into any officers. Meanwhile, Ron's mother returns to the home
    and sees Ron's dead body in the closet. She breaks down into tears, and calls the murder in to the police. While being
    questioned, the police ask if she has any idea where the husband might have been. She says she doesn't, but then one of
    the officers notices that she dropped a business card of sorts, although she doesn't recognize it at first. Picking it
    up, she sees its the business card to some motel, and she suspects maybe that is where Bruce is. Sure enough, Bruce is
    arrested by the police and is locked away in prison, presumably for the rest of his life..</b></i></i></p>
